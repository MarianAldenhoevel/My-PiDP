## PDP-11 Programming Card

The Programming Card is a quick reference for programming the machine. It includes a list of opcodes and listings for various versions of bootstrap loader code.

There are numerous scans of the original on the web. I have taken one published by Flickr-User Endogan and put it into a PDF ready for printing. My PDF is laid out for A4 paper and you can duplex-print two pages, take an exacto-knife to it, tape two parts together and fold it. I do not know the original dimensions and do not really care. After all my computer is not full size either.
