# My-PiDP
Stuff I create or collect while playing with my PiDP-11

The PiDP-11 is a modern replica of the PDP-11/70 computer in 6:10 scale. It is powered by a Raspberry Pi, unbelievably pretty and a ton of nerdy fun.

## PDP-11 Programming Card

The Programming Card is a quick reference for programming the machine. It includes a list of opcodes and listings for various versions of bootstrap loader code.

There are numerous scans of the original on the web. I have taken one published by Flickr-User [Endogan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/24989276@N00/albums/72157613479397758) and put it into a PDF ready for printing. My PDF is laid out for A4 paper and you can duplex-print two pages, take an exacto-knife to it, tape two parts together and fold it:

I do not know the original dimensions and do not really care. After all my PDP-11 is not full size either.

The download is provided in PDF format and as the ODG file which I created in Libre Office Draw.
